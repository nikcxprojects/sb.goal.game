  title: GIANLUIGI BUFFON
  description: "Career highlight: Promotion from Serie B with Juventus in 2007, capping
    a 12 months that entailed Juve\u2019s demotion for their part in the Calciopoli
    scandal and Italy\u2019s World Cup win. Buffon\u2019s decision to stay and fight
    for promotion was a pivotal one in the club's history."
