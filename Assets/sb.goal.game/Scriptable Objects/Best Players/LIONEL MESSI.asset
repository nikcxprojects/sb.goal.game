  title: LIONEL MESSI
  description: "Career highlight: Days after criticism of his aerial game, Messi
    steered a looping header over Edwin van der Sar that sealed Barcelona\u2019s
    2-0 win over Manchester United in the 2009 Champions League Final. It's one of
    his personal favourites, he once told FFT."
