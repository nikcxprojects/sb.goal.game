  title: ZINEDINE ZIDANE
  description: "Career highlight: Decisive goals in World Cup and Champions League
    finals seem the only ports of call here, but to many purists, his finest moment
    came in the quarter-finals of the 2006 World Cup. Against Brazil, though, Zidane
    put in one of the all-time great performances, a divine exhibition of dribbling
    and ball-playing from central midfield \u2013 equal parts no-nonsense maturity
    and youthful exuberance \u2013 to roll back the years, secure himself the player
    of the tournament award and guide his country towards the final."
