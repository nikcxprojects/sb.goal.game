  title: PLAYERS & EQUIPMENT
  description: 'Each team consists of 11 players. These are made up of one goalkeeper
    and ten outfield players. The pitch dimensions vary from each ground but are
    roughly 120 yards long and 75 yards wide. On each pitch you will have a 6 yard
    box next to the goal mouth, an 18 yard box surrounding the 6 yard box and a centre
    circle. Each half of the pitch must be a mirror image of the other in terms of
    dimensions.

    Essentially the equipment that is needed for a soccer match
    is pitch and a football. Additionally players can be found wearing studded football
    boots, shin pads and matching strips. The goalkeepers will additionally wear
    padded gloves as they are the only players allowed to handle the ball. Each team
    will have a designated captain.'
