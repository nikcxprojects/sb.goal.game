  description: "To score the ball must go into your opponent\u2019s goal. The whole
    ball needs to be over the line for it to be a legitimate goal. A goal can be
    scored with any part of the body apart from the hand or arm up to the shoulder.
    The goal itself consists of a frame measuring 8 feet high and 8 yards wide."
