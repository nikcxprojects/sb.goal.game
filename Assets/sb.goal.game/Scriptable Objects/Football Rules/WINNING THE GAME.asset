  title: WINNING THE GAME
  description: To win you have to score more goals than that of your opponents. If
    the scores are level after 90 minutes then the game will end as a draw apart
    from in cup games where the game can go to extra time and even a penalty shootout
    to decide the winner. Players must use their feet to kick the ball and are prohibited
    to use their hands apart from goalkeepers who can use any part of their body
    within the 18 yard box (of which more can be found out in the next section).
